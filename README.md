Tombolone
=========

The application consists of two parts:

  - tombolone: is a pygame application wich project the tombola's game to the raspberry pi video output (hdmi/s-video)
  - tomboloneweb: is a flask web application which permit to control the game
  
Tombolone and tomboloneweb communicate through dbus.

See prerequisites.txt for software needed to run this application.

See screenshots in snapshots/ folder.

I will upload a complete SD image in a few days.

Every hint is welcome!
